NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Travis::ConfigForReleaseBranch - Create a
    .travis.yml suitable for built branches

VERSION

    This document describes version 0.004 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Travis::ConfigForReleaseBranch - released April
    29, 2015 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Travis-ConfigForReleaseBranch.

SYNOPSIS

        ; in your dist.ini
        [Travis::ConfigForReleaseBranch]

DESCRIPTION

    This is a simple Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles plugin to include a
    sensible -- or so this author believes -- .travis.yml suitable for
    running Travis-CI jobs <http://travis-ci.org> off of a release branch
    like one generated by the Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::CommitBuild plugin.

    By default, we build against Perl 5.8, 5.10, 5.12, 5.14, 5.16, 5.18,
    5.20, and 5.21. The 5.8 and 5.21 build jobs are allowed to fail without
    causing the entire build run to fail.

EARLY VERSION!

    Yep, this is an early, early version. No tests, and no flexibility in
    configuration details. Anyone wishing to assist (and faster than this
    author in remedying this sad, sad state of affairs) is more than
    welcome to submit pull requests. Good pull requests are likely to earn
    the undying gratitude of this humble CPAN author.

    release works like this because I need them or I find it enjoyable;
    however, don't let that stop you if you feel like it ;)
